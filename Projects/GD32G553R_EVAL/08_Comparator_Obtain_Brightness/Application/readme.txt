  This demo is based on the GD32G553R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator trigger interrupt using an external interrupt line. 

  CMP1 is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.2V.
  - Non Inverting input is connected to PA3.
  - Output is internally connected to EXTI line 21.
  EXTI is configured as following:
  - Enable the exti line 21 interrupt.

  In this demo, PA3 connect to VR2, EXTI line 21 is configured to generate an 
interrupt on edge of the output signal. 
  After system start-up, if the Non Inverting input is bigger than 1.2V, LED2 is on,
otherwise, LED2 is off.
