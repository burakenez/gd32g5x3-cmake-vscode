  This demo is based on the GD32G553R-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows the logic AND function interrupt. In 
this demo, PB6 and PB5 is selected as input of SIGS0 and SIGS1 respectively. PA2 is used as CLA0OUT. 

  Both PB5 and PB6 are configured as output. PB6 outputs HIGH while PB5 toggled every 200ms. CLA0 rising edge 
 interrupt is enabled. When rising edge of PB5 appears, the demo goes to CLA_IRQHandler and LED1toggles. 
 Connect the PB6, PB5 and PA2 to an oscilloscope to monitor waveform. The waveform will like this:

high            __________________________________________________   PB6(input)
               |
low     _______|

high             _________           _________           __________  PB5(input)
                |         |         |         |         |         
low      _______|         |_________|         |_________|           
                
                |<-200ms->|

high             _________           _________           _________   PA2(output)
                |         |         |         |         |
low     ________|         |_________|         |_________|

                |<-200ms->|
